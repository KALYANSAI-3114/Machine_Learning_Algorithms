# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch 🚀

This repository contains **machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch** using only **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, without relying on high-level ML libraries such as `scikit-learn`.

The goal of this project is to **deeply understand the core mathematics and logic behind ML algorithms** and to build a strong foundation by implementing them manually.

## 📌 Current Implementation

### ✅ Linear Regression (From Scratch)

- Implemented **Simple Linear Regression** using **Gradient Descent**
- No use of `scikit-learn`
- Includes:
  - Feature scaling (standardization)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
  - Gradient descent optimization
  - Correct visualization of regression line
  - Loss vs Epochs plot
  - Prediction on new data

📂 **Technologies Used**
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Workflow Overview

1. Generate or load dataset  
2. Apply feature scaling  
3. Initialize model parameters  
4. Train model using gradient descent  
5. Track loss during training  
6. Visualize results  
7. Make predictions on unseen data

## 🧠 Why From Scratch?

Implementing algorithms from scratch helps to:
- Understand the mathematics behind ML
- Learn how optimization actually works
- Debug issues like exploding gradients and scaling problems
- Build strong fundamentals for interviews and real-world ML systems

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

This repository will be expanded to include more algorithms such as:

- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Descent Variants (Batch, SGD, Mini-batch)
- Evaluation Metrics (R², MAE, RMSE) from scratch

Each algorithm will be:
- Implemented from scratch
- Well-documented
- Visualized for better understanding
